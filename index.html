        <p class="lead mb-4">I am an Undergraduate Researcher at the Gray Hydrology Lab at UCR studying microplastics in riverine and ocean ecosystems. I will be graduating this December and will continue in my lab as a junior specialist. I have been in this lab for 3 years and have been involved in a number of projects. I began doing my own field study under a project R’Clean Community. I collected trash outside of my apartment for 4 weeks and utilized Google My Maps, ArcGIS, and Image J to produce a dataset that included the items I found, the material they were made out of, the brand of the item if applicable, the lat-long coordinates of where it was found, and the time stamp. This information was used to monitor litter regeneration rates and identify any potential liter transport mechanisms, such as wind or rain, which was used to help inform Riverside County on how to manage litter locally. I did a small study analyzing months of Twitter data to assess the public’s perception of litter and the plastic pollution crisis. I turned this into a poster I presented at SETAC 2019 in Toronto, Canada. <br><br>

        I have some experience abroad as well; in 2019 I worked with the nonprofit group Renew Oceans in Varanasi, India trying to clean up the Ganges River. I worked for a month in India helping the organization and acting as my lab’s sole researcher collecting data on microplastic concentrations in the Asi River, a Ganges tributary. This was an extremely valuable experience professionally and personally for me and I hope to do more abroad work in the future. I have some experience coding in R and building Shiny Apps; I helped develop the open-source spectral analysis website, Open Specy, and am coauthored on the associated manuscript. I built my own website, the Trash Taxonomy, which aims to harmonize the massive amounts of data that exist from litter surveys globally. The site includes a series of relational tables available for download, as well as a query tool for users to develop survey sheets and compare existing datasheets through a taxonomic naming scheme. <br><br>

        Currently, I am researching microplastics in rivers and along the coast in Los Angeles and Orange Counties in southern California. We run coarse microplastic samples (250-1000 microns) and fine microplastic samples (25-250 microns). I am involved in the field collection, lab processing, and data analysis of the project. We have a series of samples over dry and wet seasons, as well as samples from storm events. The processing of these samples involves many techniques, including fluorescence microscopy, FTIR Spectroscopy, and countless others. I am currently looking for a lab group to join in Fall 2022 to begin a PhD. I am interested in fate and transport of contaminants in the environment, as well as hydrologic modeling and using data/computer science to help advance the field of plastic pollution research.  I am currently trying to ascertain my own research funding for a project studying microplastic tire wear particles and to better understand land to ocean transport of such particles but am also willing to join an existing project that aligns with my passions!
